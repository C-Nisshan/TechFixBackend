# TechFix Backend

## Overview

TechFix Backend is a procurement management system designed for a local computer shop, TechFix. It streamlines the procurement process by automating tasks like requesting quotes from suppliers, placing orders, managing inventory, and handling user authentication for staff members.

This project uses **ASP.NET Core** for the backend and integrates with **Microsoft SQL Server** for data management.
